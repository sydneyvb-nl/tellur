# Tellur — Project Status & Agent Guide

**Last updated:** 2026-06-10 (A12 opt-in source links; on feature branch)
**Maintained by:** agents — alle agents mogen dit updaten
**Repo:** github.com/sydneyvb-nl/tellur
**Branch:** main
**License:** Apache-2.0 (core) · FSL-1.1-ALv2 (`crates/server`)

> **2026-06-10 — A12 opt-in source links (provider deep-link variant).** On
> branch `feat/source-links`. Implements the safe half of A12 from the dashboard
> plan — "Git-provider link/fetch" — **without** the hub ever storing or proxying
> source. A per-repo `repo_source` template (schema v16, SQLite + PG) holds only
> a URL template; `set_repo_source`/`get_repo_source` + `PUT
> /v1/orgs/{org}/repos/{repo}/source` (admin, validates `https://`, ≤2048 chars,
> audited). The attributions read now returns `source_template`, and the File
> view renders a per-range **View ↗** deep link (`{path}` (URL-encoded per
> segment) /`{start}`/`{end}` substituted, https-guarded client-side too).
> Verified: server tests
> (`dashboard_api` set/clear/surface + https+admin validation; PG parity for
> get/set), SPA 40 vitest (new `source` helper tests) + svelte-check + build;
> clippy -D warnings + cargo-deny green. The **inline full-source gutter** (hub
> serving bytes; option 2 of A12) stays deferred — it needs a provider proxy with
> SSRF allow-listing + secret redaction, its own careful design. Remaining
> follow-ups: full i18n, Playwright E2E, A12 inline-source proxy.

> **2026-06-10 — Sealed-checkpoint audit retention.** On branch
> `feat/audit-checkpoint`. The audit hash chain can now be minimised without
> losing tamper-evidence. `audit_head` gains `sealed_hash`/`sealed_count`
> (schema v15, SQLite + PG): `seal_audit_before(cutoff)` deletes entries with
> `ts < cutoff` and records the pruned prefix's tip hash + length as a
> checkpoint. `verify_audit_chain` now **seeds** the walk from that checkpoint
> (via a new `base` arg on the shared `chain::verify`), so the retained suffix —
> or an empty chain — still verifies against the head and truncation stays
> detectable. The retention loop gains a second window: `RetentionPolicy { jobs_days,
> audit_days }`, driven by `TELLUR_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 0 = keep). The
> event chain is deliberately untouched (events are the provenance data). Verified:
> `tests/jobs.rs` seal test (partial seal → remainder verifies; append-after-seal;
> full seal → empty chain verifies) + PG parity; full workspace tests, clippy -D
> warnings + cargo-deny green. Remaining follow-ups: full i18n, Playwright E2E,
> A12 (opt-in full-source gutter).

> **2026-06-10 — Data retention / lifecycle hygiene.** On branch
> `feat/retention`. A background maintenance loop (`jobs::spawn_maintenance`,
> hourly) prunes **transient** data only: expired browser sessions and stale
> OIDC login transactions are always cleaned up; finished (`completed`/`failed`)
> jobs are pruned when `TELLUR_RETENTION_DAYS > 0` (default 0 = keep). New Store
> methods `prune_expired_sessions` + `prune_finished_jobs(cutoff)` (SQLite + PG);
> `run_maintenance_once` is pure-ish and unit-tested. The tamper-evident **event
> and audit chains are never pruned** (that would break verification; a future
> "sealed checkpoint" design is the path for compliance-driven minimisation).
> Retention is read from env in `run()` (not `Config`), so no test-literal churn.
> Verified: full workspace tests (new retention test in `tests/jobs.rs` + PG
> parity for both prune methods), clippy -D warnings + cargo-deny green; PG tests
> pass against a local Postgres. Remaining: full i18n, Playwright E2E, A12
> (opt-in full-source gutter), sealed-checkpoint audit retention.

> **2026-06-10 — Evidence exports (A13 + org evidence pack).** On branch
> `feat/evidence-exports`. The durable-job queue gains a `params` column (schema
> v14, SQLite + PG) so jobs can carry arguments. **A13**: per-repo SLSA/SPDX now
> run as durable jobs — `POST /v1/orgs/{org}/repos/{repo}/export/slsa|spdx`
> (admin / per-repo-admin) enqueue `KIND_EXPORT_SLSA|SPDX` with `{repo_id,
> repo_url?, commit?}` params; the synchronous `GET` forms stay. **Evidence
> pack**: `POST /v1/orgs/{org}/export/evidence` (admin) enqueues
> `KIND_EXPORT_EVIDENCE`, a worker job that bundles every repo's SLSA provenance
> + the latest compliance snapshots + the audit chain's verification state into
> one downloadable result. The Exports console gets a primary "Evidence pack"
> action (reuses the existing job-poll + download). Verified: full workspace
> tests (new `evidence_pack_*`, `per_repo_slsa_export_*` incl. admin-only; jobs
> param round-trip; PG parity), SPA 36 vitest + svelte-check (0/0) + build;
> clippy -D warnings + cargo-deny green; `cargo build --features dashboard`
> embeds. Remaining: full i18n, Playwright E2E, A12 (opt-in full-source gutter),
> backup/retention.

> **2026-06-10 — Dashboard: composed `/overview` (A9) + density toggle.** On
> branch `feat/dashboard-overview-density`. Two bundled items. **A9**: new
> `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/overview` (viewer+, rate-limited, off-runtime) returns the
> landing screen in one round-trip — org totals, org-wide AI share + review
> coverage (folds attribution across repos), a 30-day activity series, repos
> **ranked by review gap** (most unreviewed AI lines first), and a recent-activity
> feed; the Overview screen now makes a single fetch and surfaces the review-gap
> ranking + an AI-reviewed KPI (warns under 50%). **Density toggle**: a
> Cozy/Compact control in the topbar drives `--row-pad-*` / `--card-pad` spacing
> tokens via `<html data-density>`, persisted to localStorage and applied before
> first paint; threaded through every table/card. Verified: full workspace tests
> (new `overview_*` coverage incl. tenant scoping + review-gap ranking; PG parity
> unaffected), SPA 36 vitest + svelte-check (0/0) + build; clippy -D warnings +
> cargo-deny green. Remaining follow-ups: full i18n, Playwright E2E, A12 (opt-in
> full-source gutter), A13 (job-backed SLSA/SPDX), backup/retention.
>
> **2026-06-10 — Team dashboard D5 (polish: command palette + theme + a11y).**
> On branch `feat/dashboard-d5`. Cross-cutting polish on the SPA. **Command
> palette** (⌘K / Ctrl-K): role-aware, org-scoped quick nav with subsequence
> fuzzy match, full keyboard operation (arrows/enter/esc) and an accessible
> `role="dialog"` listbox; pure `buildCommands`/`filterCommands` unit-tested.
> **Theme**: system/light/dark preference (cycled from the topbar), persisted to
> localStorage and applied to `<html data-theme>` before content paints; pure
> `resolveTheme`/`nextPref`/`normalizePref` unit-tested. **A11y**: skip-to-content
> link, `aria-current="page"` on the active rail item, and a global
> `:focus-visible` ring. Verified: SPA 34 vitest + svelte-check (0 errors, 0
> warnings) + build (~31KB gzip); `cargo build --features dashboard` embeds the
> bundle. **Deferred from the D5 plan (honest scope):** density toggle, full i18n
> (needs a string-catalog framework), Playwright E2E (needs a server+SSO harness
> in CI), and a dedicated performance pass — tracked as follow-ups, not shipped
> here. With this, the team-dashboard plan (D0–D5 core) is delivered.
>
> **2026-06-10 — Team dashboard D4 UI (Policies + People & Access).** On branch
> `feat/dashboard-d4-ui`. Two admin-only SPA screens on the D4 API. **Policies**:
> per-repo compliance from `GET .../policies/compliance` — KPI band (repos
> evaluated, open violations, severity split), a most-at-risk-first table
> (AI ranges, violations, severity chips high=risk/medium=warn/low=muted, policy
> version, last run), a "Re-evaluate" action that enqueues the durable job and
> polls it to completion, and a guided empty state when no `default` policy has
> run. **People & Access**: an SSO/SCIM status band (OIDC issuer, SCIM token age,
> active/total members, SSO-bound count, group count — health only), a members
> table (role chip, email, SSO-bound, active/deactivated; inactive sorted last),
> and a groups table (displayName → derived role). Admin-only rail items
> (Policies, People & Access) now active; routes `/app/orgs/:org/policies` and
> `.../people`. Verified: SPA 22 vitest + svelte-check (0 errors) + build
> (~29KB gzip); `cargo build --features dashboard` embeds the new bundle. Next:
> D5 polish (command palette, density/theme/i18n, a11y audit, E2E).
>
> **2026-06-10 — Team dashboard D4 API (policy compliance + People & Access).**
> On branch `feat/dashboard-d4`. API-first; the Policies + People & Access UI
> follows in a separate D4-UI PR. New admin-only, tenant-scoped endpoints:
> **A8 policy compliance** — `POST /v1/orgs/{org}/policies/compliance` enqueues a
> durable job that evaluates the org's `default` policy (via the core
> `PolicyEngine`) over every repo's attribution and persists timestamped
> snapshots per `(org, repo, policy version)`; `GET .../policies/compliance`
> reads the latest snapshot per repo (`evaluated` flag + per-repo violation
> counts by severity, Critical folded into High). **A2** `GET .../members`
> (role, email, sso_bound, active). **A11** `GET .../groups` — session-auth
> mirror of `/scim/v2/Groups` (members + derived `maps_to_role`) so the SPA
> never holds a SCIM token. **A10** `GET .../sso-status` — OIDC/SCIM health
> (issuer, scim-token age, member/sso/group counts; no secrets). Schema → v13
> (`compliance_snapshot` table); Store gains `list_members`,
> `scim_token_created_at`, `put_compliance_snapshot`, `latest_compliance`;
> worker gains `KIND_COMPLIANCE`. Verified: full workspace tests (new
> `dashboard_api` compliance + people coverage incl. admin-only/tenant + a
> policy-eval round-trip via `process_one`; PG parity), clippy -D warnings +
> cargo-deny green; PG tests pass against a local Postgres. Next: D4 UI
> (Policies + People & Access screens), then D5 polish.
>
> **2026-06-10 — Team dashboard D3 (audit read + exports).** On branch
> `feat/dashboard-d3`. API-first then UI. New admin-only, tenant-scoped read
> endpoints: `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/audit[?actor=&action=&range=&before=&limit=]`
> (A7 — paginated, newest-first read of the tamper-evident audit log; keyset
> cursor via `before=<seq>`; on the first page only, `chain_intact` reports
> whether the global hash chain still verifies — an O(n) check skipped on later
> pages) and `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/jobs` (durable-job history for the Exports
> table; results not inlined — poll `.../jobs/{id}`). Store gains `list_audit`
> (dynamic but fully parameterised filter) + `list_jobs` (SQLite + Postgres
> parity). SPA adds an **Audit log** screen (filterable table, chain-verified
> badge, load-more pagination) and an **Exports** screen (start events/audit
> exports, live job-status polling, download a completed job's JSON result);
> both are admin-only and hidden from the rail for non-admins (the API enforces
> the role too). Routes `/app/orgs/:org/audit` and `.../exports`. Verified: all
> server tests pass (incl. `dashboard_api` A7/jobs coverage + PG parity), SPA 20
> vitest + check + build (~26KB gzip); clippy -D warnings + cargo-deny green; PG
> tests pass against a local Postgres. Next: D4 (policy compliance snapshots A8 +
> People & Access A2/A10/A11).
>
> **2026-06-08 — Team dashboard D2 (evidence: attribution + sessions).** On
> branch `feat/dashboard-d2`. API-first then UI. New read endpoints (viewer+,
> tenant-scoped): `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/repos/{repo}/attributions[?path=]` (A4 —
> read stored line-level attribution; metadata only, no source text), and
> sessions (A6) — `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/sessions[?repo=&actor=&range=&limit=]`
> (events grouped by `session_id`: count, first/last ts, distinct actors/repos)
> + `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/sessions/{id}` (events oldest-first for replay). Store
> gains `list_sessions` + `session_events` (group_concat / string_agg for the
> per-session distinct facets; SQLite + Postgres parity). SPA adds a **File
> provenance view** (metadata-first gutter: per-range origin colour, agent/model,
> confidence, reviewed-by — explicitly no source text), an attributed-files list
> on Repo detail, a **Sessions** list, and a **Session replay** timeline; routes
> `/app/orgs/:org/repos/:repo/files/:path*`, `.../sessions[/:id]`; Sessions nav
> active. Verified: 269 workspace tests (incl. `dashboard_api` A4/A6 coverage +
> PG parity), SPA 18 vitest + check + build (~22KB gzip); clippy -D warnings +
> cargo-deny green; PG tests pass against a local Postgres. Next: D3 (audit read
> A7 + Exports screen).
>
> **2026-06-08 — Team dashboard D1 (activity + repositories).** On branch
> `feat/dashboard-d1-api`. API-first then UI, one PR. New read endpoints
> (viewer+, tenant-scoped): `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/activity?range=&group_by=type|actor`
> (A1 — daily event time-series; `since` filter + day bucket, SQLite `substr` /
> Postgres `left`), and `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/repos/{repo}` (A3 — single-repo
> summary: event count, contributors, last activity, and **line-level AI share +
> review coverage**). The review-gap math is a pure, unit-tested `review` module
> implementing decision §12.1 (AI range reviewed iff explicit human reviewer ≠
> producing agent, a `reviewed_at`, and passing tests where tests were run;
> documented approximation: no per-range modification ts). Store gains
> `activity_by_day` + `repo_facts` (SQLite + Postgres). SPA (Svelte) adds an
> Overview activity **trend** (bespoke SVG bars), a **Repositories** list, and a
> **Repo detail** screen (AI-share / review-coverage KPIs, contributors), with
> org-scoped routes `/app/orgs/:org/repos[/:repo]`. Verified: 266 workspace
> tests (incl. `review` unit tests + `dashboard_api` integration + PG parity),
> SPA 16 vitest + check + build (~20KB gzip); clippy -D warnings + cargo-deny
> green; PG tests pass against a local Postgres. Next: D2 (attribution read A4 +
> sessions A6 → file provenance gutter + session replay).
>
> **2026-06-08 — Team dashboard D0 (foundation).** On branch
> `feat/dashboard-d0-foundation`, executing `docs/proposals/TEAM_DASHBOARD_UI.md`
> phase D0. The hub now serves a real **team dashboard SPA at `/app`**: Svelte 5
> + TypeScript source in `crates/server/ui/`, built with Vite, embedded into the
> binary via `rust-embed` behind the default-on `dashboard` Cargo feature, served
> same-origin with SPA client-routing fallback (`/app/*` → `index.html`; unknown
> `/v1` still 404s; hashed assets cached immutably, HTML `no-cache`). `build.rs`
> creates an empty `ui/dist` so a plain `cargo build` still compiles (serving a
> placeholder); the new `dashboard` CI job and the Docker build compile the real
> SPA and embed it. The SPA ships AppShell (rail + topbar), org-scoped routing
> (`/app/orgs/:org/...`), `/v1/me` bootstrap + 401→`/auth/login?return=` redirect,
> the design tokens from the plan (Tellur-green accent, dark default + light), and
> an **Overview** screen on the existing `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/dashboard` payload
> (KPIs, repos, recent activity, event types). FSL like the rest of the server.
> Verified: Rust `tests/dashboard_routes.rs` (4) + SPA vitest (12, router/format)
> + `pnpm check`/`build` clean; workspace clippy + cargo-deny green; SPA bundle
> ~18KB gzip. Next: D1 (activity time-series A1 + repo summary A3 + repos
> screens). Decisions §12 of the plan are resolved.
>
> **2026-06-06 — Hub: durable jobs + SCIM groups + dashboard coupling.** On
> branch `feat/server-jobs-scim-groups-dashboard` (one PR, three features).
> **Durable job queue** (`jobs` module + `job` table, schema v12): org exports
> are now enqueued (`POST .../export/events|audit` → 202 + `job_id`) and run by a
> background worker (`spawn_worker`; `process_one` is deterministic for tests),
> polled at `GET .../jobs/{id}` (admin, tenant-scoped). Atomic claim via SQLite
> IMMEDIATE / Postgres `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. **SCIM Groups** (`/scim/v2/Groups`
> CRUD + `scim_group`/`scim_group_member`): a group `displayName` of
> `tellur-admin|contributor|viewer` drives members' org role, recomputed on
> membership/rename/delete; mutations audited. **Dashboard coupling**:
> `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/dashboard` (viewer; session-cookie or token) returns the
> org rollup + a recent-activity feed (`recent_org_events`); `web/index.html`
> gains a hub mode (`?hub=&org=`, `credentials:include`, served same-origin to
> avoid CORS). SQLite + Postgres parity throughout. Verified: new
> `tests/jobs.rs`, SCIM group + dashboard tests, updated export tests (202+poll);
> 252 workspace tests; clippy -D warnings + cargo-deny green; PG tests pass
> against a local Postgres. Remaining hub work: backup/retention; a fuller
> dashboard UI.
>
> **2026-06-06 — Tier 1 B6 (enterprise) — SCIM 2.0 provisioning (B6 complete).**
> On branch `feat/server-b6-scim`. New `scim` module exposes `/scim/v2/Users`
> (list/create/get/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) so an IdP can auto-provision and, crucially,
> **deprovision** hub members. Auth is a dedicated, org-scoped SCIM bearer token
> (`scim_token` table, Argon2id-hashed, minted via `tellur-server admin
> create-scim-token`); the org comes from the token, never the URL. A SCIM user
> maps to a member + SSO identity: `userName`→email, `displayName`/`name`→display
> name, optional `roles`→org role (default `viewer`), `externalId` round-tripped.
> Schema v11 adds `member.active` + `member_identity.external_id`; **all three
> auth paths (API token, session, SSO email lookup) now filter `active`**, so
> `DELETE`/`PATCH active=false` revokes a member across every credential type
> immediately. SQLite + Postgres parity. Scope: Users only — Group-based role
> sync is deferred (documented). Verified: `tests/scim.rs` (provision → list/get
> /filter, duplicate→409, bad/no token→401, deactivate→auth fails but still
> listed, PATCH reactivate+role change, tenant isolation) + `scim` unit tests +
> Postgres parity; 243 workspace tests; clippy -D warnings + cargo-deny green; PG
> tests pass against a local Postgres. **B6 (enterprise) is now complete**
> (per-repo RBAC + OIDC SSO + SCIM). Remaining hub work: queued/durable jobs.
>
> **2026-06-06 — Tier 1 B6 (enterprise) — OIDC SSO.** On branch
> `feat/server-b6-oidc-sso`. Browser single sign-on via OIDC Authorization Code
> + PKCE. New `oidc` module: PKCE (S256), authorize-URL builder, ID-token claim
> validation (`iss`/`aud`/`exp`/`nonce`) — signature integrity rests on the
> TLS-secured direct token-endpoint channel (OIDC Core §3.1.3.7), documented in
> the threat model. The IdP boundary is behind an `OidcClient` trait
> (`HttpOidcClient` over ureq/rustls; a mock drives the tests with no network).
> New routes `/auth/login`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/logout`; the `Principal`
> extractor now accepts an API bearer token **or** an opaque, DB-backed session
> cookie (`HttpOnly`/`Secure`/`SameSite=Lax`, 8h). Schema v9 adds
> `member_identity` (email + bound OIDC subject), `oidc_login` (CSRF state →
> PKCE/nonce), and `session`; full SQLite + Postgres parity. No open
> self-registration: sign-in is limited to members provisioned by verified email
> (`tellur-server admin add-member`), with the OIDC subject bound on first login.
> Deps: `ureq`(+rustls TLS), `base64`, `sha2`; `deny.toml` now allows
> `CDLA-Permissive-2.0` (webpki-roots). Verified: `oidc` unit tests (PKCE,
> authorize URL, claim validation good/bad), `tests/oidc.rs` end-to-end via mock
> IdP (login→callback→session→/v1/me→logout, unprovisioned/unverified→403, CSRF
> state→400, SSO-disabled→404, bearer still works), Postgres parity in
> `tests/postgres.rs`; 235 workspace tests; clippy -D warnings + cargo-deny
> green; PG tests pass against a local Postgres. Next B6 slice: SCIM.
>
> **2026-06-05 — Tier 1 B6 (enterprise) — fine-grained per-repo RBAC.** On
> branch `feat/server-b6-repo-rbac`. First slice of B6: per-repo role grants on
> top of the org-level RBAC. Grants are **additive** — a member's effective role
> on a repo is `max(org_role, repo_grant)`, so a grant can elevate (e.g. an org
> viewer becomes a contributor or admin on one repo) but never reduces a member
> below their org baseline. New `repo_role` table (schema v8, both SQLite and
> Postgres backends), `Store` methods (`set/get/remove/list_repo_role(s)`,
> tenant-scoped: the repo *and* the member must belong to the org → no
> cross-tenant grants), `Role::max`, and an `effective_role` helper used by the
> write/export handlers (event + attribution ingest honour per-repo contributor
> grants; per-repo SLSA/SPDX export honours per-repo admin grants). Management
> endpoints (org-admin only, audited): `PUT/DELETE /v1/orgs/{org}/repos/{repo}/
> roles/{member}` + `GET .../roles`, plus `tellur-server admin
> grant-repo-role|revoke-repo-role|list-repo-roles`. Verified: new
> `tests/repo_rbac.rs` (grant elevates a viewer, scope is per-repo, revoke
> restores baseline, per-repo admin export, admin-only + tenant-scoped
> management) + Postgres parity in `tests/postgres.rs`; 223 workspace tests;
> clippy -D warnings + cargo-deny green; PG tests pass against a local Postgres.
> Next B6 slices: OIDC SSO, then SCIM.
>
> **2026-06-05 — Tier 1 B5 Postgres backend.** On branch `feat/server-postgres`.
> The hub now has a second storage backend: `PostgresStore`
> (`crates/server/src/storage/postgres.rs`) implements the full `Store` trait
> over an `r2d2` connection pool (sync `postgres` client, `NoTls`). Backend
> selection is by config — set `TELLUR_DATABASE_URL` and `build_state` uses
> Postgres, otherwise the embedded SQLite store (zero-config) is used. Semantics
> are mirrored exactly: same tenant scoping, the same server-side hash-chain
> recomputation, and the same head-hash + length checkpoints for truncation
> detection; the per-repo event chain and audit chain appends take a
> `pg_advisory_xact_lock` so the read-head + insert + head-update stay atomic
> across pooled connections (the Postgres equivalent of SQLite's
> `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`). New integration tests (`crates/server/tests/postgres.rs`)
> cover the whole trait surface + a tamper-detection case; they run only when
> `TELLUR_TEST_DATABASE_URL` points at a disposable DB (the test resets the
> `public` schema). CI gains a `postgres:16` service so those tests run on every
> PR. Docs (README/AGENTS/THREAT_MODEL/compose) updated; the threat model now
> records the hub↔Postgres link as a NoTls trust boundary (private network / TLS
> proxy; connection string is a secret). Verified locally against a real
> Postgres (`postgres://postgres@127.0.0.1:5433/tellur_test`): both PG tests
> pass; 218 workspace tests; clippy `-D warnings` + cargo-deny green. (Docker
> image build is verified in CI.) Next: B6 (enterprise SSO/OIDC + RBAC/SCIM).
>
> **2026-06-04 — B4 review fixes (Codex).** Addressed 3 P2 findings on PR #6:
> org event exports now carry `repo_id` per event (multi-repo context);
> `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` updated for the policy-write + export endpoints
> (disclosure/DoS, policy bodies validated/declarative); and `README.md` now
> documents the self-hosted hub (preview) instead of saying it's unimplemented.
>
> **2026-06-04 — Clawpatch report fixes (Codex).** On branch
> `codex/clawpatch-report-fixes`. Addressed Clawpatch findings across server,
> CLI, workflows, and JetBrains: `tellur-server admin create-token` now requires
> an explicit role and records admin-CLI token creation without falsely naming
> the new member as actor; `tellur-core` is a real diagnostic CLI with
> help/version/error behavior; PR provenance workflow uses the checked-out
> binary and immutable PR SHAs from a read-only report job, while PR commenting
> runs in a separate write-scoped job that does not execute PR code; release
> builds use the pinned Rust toolchain; readiness checks verify the migrated
> store; graceful shutdown handles SIGTERM; `tellur init --profile` validates
> supported profiles; `doctor` uses cross-platform executable PATH lookup and
> reports unreadable policy/trace directories; test helpers now require JSON
> problem bodies; read/policy/export/auth/ingest coverage was tightened; SLSA
> materials preserve file identity with percent-encoded file paths; repo ID
> lookup is preferred before repo-name fallback; JetBrains capture now
> deduplicates VFS bursts, re-queues saves that arrive during active capture,
> uses a disposable bounded single-worker queue, logs CLI failures/timeouts, has
> a bounded IDE compatibility range, and includes automated runner tests.
> Verified: `cargo fmt`; `cargo test` (216 Rust tests);
> `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`; `cargo deny check`

> **2026-06-04 — Attribution/SLSA review fixes (Codex).** Addressed 3 P2
> findings on PR #8: ingest now rejects malformed attribution ranges
> (`start_line == 0` or `start > end`) before storage, so SPDX/SLSA line-count
> math can't underflow; and the core SLSA + SPDX structs now serialize the
> **standard JSON field names** (`predicateType`/`buildType`/`configSource`/
> `entryPoint`; `spdxVersion`/`dataLicense`/`SPDXID`/`documentNamespace`/…) via
> `rename_all = "camelCase"` (+ explicit `SPDXID`), so the attestations are
> accepted by SLSA/in-toto and SPDX 2.3 tooling — this also fixes the standalone
> `tellur export slsa|spdx` output. 59 server tests; workspace 204.
>
> **2026-06-04 — Attribution ingest + org SLSA/SPDX export.** On branch
> `feat/server-b6-attribution-slsa`. The hub now ingests line-level attribution
> (`POST /v1/orgs/{org}/repos/{repo}/attributions`, contributor+, per-file

> export: `GET .../repos/{repo}/export/slsa` and `.../export/spdx` (admin) build
> real SLSA v1.0 provenance + SPDX SBOM from the stored attribution via core's

> Exports run off the async runtime and are audited. Verified: 58 server tests

> report + both exports) now run via `spawn_blocking` so they don't stall the
> async runtime; **packaging** — multi-stage `dist/docker/Dockerfile` +
> `docker-compose.yml` + a CI job that builds the image (docker isn't available
> locally, so it's verified in CI). Follow-up shipped: **`tellur policy pull`**
> in the Apache CLI (small `ureq` client, no TLS deps; validates before writing
> to `.tellur/policies/`) with a live end-to-end test that boots a real hub.
> Verified: 55 server + 26 CLI tests; workspace 200; clippy + cargo-deny green.
> **Deferred (with reasons):** the Postgres backend → its own PR (needs a DB +
> CI service); a persistent/queued job system → lands with Postgres; org-level
> SLSA/SPDX export → needs the hub to ingest line-level attribution first (the
> generators take `FileAttribution`, not events), so it is gated on an
> attribution-ingest feature rather than faking line data. Next: B5-pg
> (Postgres) then B6 (enterprise/SSO).
>
> **2026-06-04 — Tier 1 B4 (central policy & export).** On branch
> `feat/server-b4-policy-export`. **Central policy distribution:**
> `PUT /v1/orgs/{org}/policies/{name}` (admin; body validated as Tellur policy
> YAML via new `PolicyEngine::from_yaml_str`, auto-versioned), `GET .../policies`
> (list), `GET .../policies/{name}` (pull, audited) + `tellur-server admin
> set-policy --file`. **Export portal:** `GET .../export/events` and
> `GET .../export/audit` (admin, rate-limited, audited; audit export includes a
> `chain_intact` integrity flag). New `policy` table (schema v6), storage
> `put_policy/list_policies/get_policy/export_events/export_audit`. Verified: 53
> server tests + live smoke (CLI set-policy → pull, invalid → 400, audit export);
> workspace 197; clippy + deny green. Org-level SLSA/SPDX export and the Apache
> CLI `tellur policy pull` client are noted follow-ups. Next: B5 (scale & ops).
>
> **2026-06-04 — Shared hash-chain helper (refactor).** On branch
> `refactor/server-hash-chain`. Extracted the tamper-evident chain logic that
> review flagged twice (missing head checkpoint) into one
> `crates/server/src/storage/chain.rs`: `read_head`/`write_head` + a generic
> `verify` (walk + prev-linkage + per-row hash recompute closure + head/length
> comparison). The audit log and per-repo event log now both use it, so any
> future chain gets tail-truncation detection for free. Behavior-preserving:
> all 191 tests pass unchanged; clippy + cargo-deny green.
>
> **2026-06-04 — Tier 1 B3 (read & report).** On branch
> `feat/server-b3-read-report`. Added tenant-scoped read endpoints (all audit
> cross-org denials, BOLA-blocked): `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/repos` (repos + event
> counts), `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/repos/{repo}/events` (newest-first, cursor
> pagination by `seq`, limit clamped 1..200, 404 on unknown repo), and
> `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/report` (org rollup: total/distinct-sessions/by-type/
> by-actor/per-repo, audited). Storage: `find_repo`, `list_repos`, `list_events`,
> `org_report`. Verified: 44 server tests (read BOLA/404/401/pagination + report
> aggregation + tenant scoping) + live smoke; workspace fmt/clippy/test (188) +
> deny green. Dashboard wiring (`web/`) deferred to a follow-up. Next: B4
> (central policy & export).
>
> **2026-06-04 — B3 review fixes (Codex).** Addressed 4 P2 findings on PR #4:
> successful event reads are now audited; `Principal` is extracted before
> `Query` so auth/tenant checks (401/403) precede query-param parsing (400);
> corrupt stored payloads surface as an error instead of `null`; and the org
> report is rate-limited + index-backed (`idx_event_org`, schema v5) with a
> job-backed path noted for B5. 47 server tests; workspace 191.
>
> **2026-06-03 — Tier 1 B2 (ingest & verify).** On branch
> `feat/server-b2-ingest`. Added authenticated provenance ingest:
> `POST /v1/orgs/{org}/repos/{repo}/events` (contributor+ role, cross-tenant →
> 403/BOLA). The hub get-or-creates the repo, **recomputes the per-repo hash
> chain** with core's `hash_event` (clients can't forge), and **redacts secrets
> from inbound payloads** before storage (verified live: a secret lands as
> `[REDACTED]` in the DB). Guardrails: 1 MiB body limit (router layer), max 1000
> events/request, and a per-member fixed-window rate limiter → `429`. New
> `event`/`repo` tables (schema v3) + `verify_event_chain`. Verified: 38 server
> tests (incl. ingest BOLA/role/caps/rate-limit + chain tamper) + live smoke;
> workspace fmt/clippy/test (182) + deny green. Next: B3 (read & report).
>
> **2026-06-03 — B2 review fixes (Codex).** Addressed 2 findings on PR #3: the
> per-repo event chain now persists an `event_head` checkpoint (head-hash +
> count) so tail truncation is detected by `verify_event_chain` (P1, mirrors
> `audit_head`); and `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` is updated for the new ingest trust
> boundary (P2). 39 server tests; 183 workspace.
>
> **2026-06-03 — Tier 1 B1 (identity & tenancy).** On branch
> `feat/server-b1-identity-tenancy`. Added to `crates/server`: an `auth` module
> (viewer/contributor/admin roles; API tokens `tlr_<id>_<secret>` with the secret
> stored only as an **Argon2id** hash; split id/secret for constant-work lookup),
> storage for orgs/members/tokens + a **tamper-evident hash-chained audit log**
> (append/verify/tamper-detect), a deny-by-default axum auth extractor
> (`Principal` from `Authorization: Bearer`), tenant-scoped endpoints
> `GET /v1/me` and `GET /v1/orgs/{org}/me` (object+tenant authz → **BOLA**
> blocked), and a `tellur-server admin create-org/create-token` bootstrap CLI.
> Verified: 25 server tests incl. cross-org BOLA regression; live end-to-end
> smoke (401/200/403); fmt/clippy/test/deny green. Next: B2 (ingest & verify).
>
> **2026-06-03 — B1 review fixes (Codex).** Addressed 4 P2 findings on PR #2:
> audit appends now run in a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction (atomic across
> connections); the audit chain persists a head-hash/length checkpoint so tail
> truncation is detected by `verify_audit_chain`; Argon2 verification runs off
> the async worker via `spawn_blocking` and releases the DB lock first; and
> presented-but-invalid bearer tokens are now audited (`auth_denied`) while
> header-less requests are not (avoids anonymous audit flooding).
>
> **2026-06-03 — CI hardening.** Fixed a clippy failure that only surfaced on
> the Ubuntu CI (an unnecessary `match` inside a Linux-only `#[cfg]` block that
> macOS-local clippy never compiles). Durable follow-ups: pinned the toolchain in
> `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.96.0) so local/CI clippy match; dropped the redundant
> `cargo-audit` CI step (cargo-deny already scans RustSec); bumped
> `actions/checkout` v4→v5 (Node 20 EOL). CI is green.
>
> **2026-06-03 — Tier 1 B0 shipped (server scaffolding).** New FSL-licensed
> `crates/server` (`tellur-server` binary), the secure foundation before any data
> endpoints. Secure-by-default config (refuses non-loopback bind without explicit
> opt-in; validated at boot), typed errors → RFC 9457 `problem+json` that never
> leak internals on 5xx, a swappable `Store` trait with a SQLite backend
> (WAL/foreign-keys, idempotent migrate), `AppState` + axum router with
> `/healthz` + `/readyz`, structured `tracing`, graceful shutdown. Added
> `SECURITY.md` (coordinated disclosure + CRA reporting), `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`
> (STRIDE), `deny.toml` + a CI workflow (`cargo fmt`/`clippy`/`test` +
> `cargo-deny` + `cargo-audit`). Verified: 10 server tests; `cargo deny check` →
> advisories/bans/licenses/sources ok; live binary smoke-tested.
>
> **2026-06-03 — Tier 1 implementation plan.** Researched current security &
> compliance standards (OWASP ASVS 5.0, OWASP API Top 10 2023/BOLA, EU CRA,
> SLSA v1.0, NIST SSDF, GDPR, SOC 2/ISO 27001 readiness, Sigstore/SBOM) and
> wrote a secure-by-design, maintainable, scalable plan for the `tellur serve`
> hub: `docs/proposals/TEAM_SERVER_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (new FSL `crates/server`,
> thin-handler/fat-service layering, swappable SQLite→Postgres `Store` trait,
> data-layer tenant scoping to kill BOLA, hash-chained audit log, phased B0–B6
> with CI security gates). Plan only — no code yet.
>
> **2026-06-03 — Team mode Tier 0 shipped.** First build of roadmap item #8.
> `tellur team report` aggregates the `refs/notes/ai` authorship notes of every
> commit in a `--base..--head` range into one team view: AI vs human lines, by
> tool / model / author, plus provenance coverage (which commits carry a note).
> Pure Git-native, no server — notes travel over the existing remote. Pure
> aggregation core in `crates/core/src/report/team_report.rs` (+3 unit tests),
> CLI `tellur team report [--base --head --notes-ref --json]` (+1 integration
> test). Tolerant: missing/unparseable notes count as "without provenance"
> rather than failing. Phase A is complete: an example PR workflow lives at
> `docs/examples/github-actions-team-report.yml` (fetch notes → aggregate →
> upsert one PR comment).
>
> **2026-06-03 — Licensing direction.** Documented the license/structure
> direction in `docs/proposals/LICENSING.md`: Apache-2.0 for the core
> (CLI/core/adapters/schemas/editor); the future team/server component
> (`crates/server`) under FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0 in the same monorepo; contributions
> via DCO, no CLA. Direction only — not implemented; not legal advice.
>
> **2026-06-03 — Team/server mode proposal.** Researched roadmap item #8 against
> the existing local-first primitives (Git notes, per-repo hash chain, daemon,
> export profiles, policy) and the target segments (independent/OSS, SMB,
> corporate). Wrote a phased design proposal at
> `docs/proposals/TEAM_SERVER_MODE.md`: keep local-first as default, use Git
> notes as the zero-infra team transport, and add an optional self-hostable
> `tellur serve` hub. Decided MVP path: **Tier 0 (`tellur team report`, no
> server) first, then Tier 1 (self-hosted hub)**. Proposal only — no code yet;
> reconciled with the PRD (§6 surface 11, §16.2 Layer 5, §32 Step 20; note PRD
> §24 is *Architecture Guardian*, not team mode).
>
> **2026-06-03 — Devin webhook + JetBrains plugin.** Continued roadmap item #7
> ("live capture beyond import") for the remaining adoption tools.
> **Devin** now has a first-class daemon webhook: `POST /webhook/{source}`
> (token-auth, loopback-only) in `crates/core/src/daemon/` normalizes a tool's
> native run/session payload (messages, shell commands, file edits, status) into
> canonical Tellur events, hashing prompt-like fields, redacting commands, and
> **recomputing the hash chain** so provenance cannot be forged. The normalizer
> lives in `crates/core/src/daemon/webhook.rs` (core can't depend on the adapters
> crate). **JetBrains** now has a real IntelliJ Platform plugin under
> `editor/tellur-jetbrains/` (Kotlin/Gradle): it subscribes to `VFS_CHANGES` and
> routes saved/created files to `tellur hooks ingest --source jetbrains
> --auto-init`, capturing AI Assistant and Junie edits live; capture is
> best-effort and off the EDT. The plugin builds outside the Rust workspace CI
> (JDK 17 + IntelliJ SDK via Gradle); the Gradle wrapper is committed and
> `./gradlew buildPlugin` is verified green on JDK 17 (loadable plugin zip).
> Added 4 Rust tests (webhook normalization + authenticated route).
>
> **2026-06-02 — Windsurf live capture.** Started roadmap item #7 ("live capture
> beyond import") for the adoption tools. Windsurf/Cascade now has live capture,
> not just import: `tellur setup windsurf` (and `tellur setup agents`) writes
> Windsurf user settings plus `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`, so the
> VS Code-compatible Tellur extension captures saves with source `windsurf` and
> Windsurf agents can call Tellur MCP tools — mirroring the Cursor integration.
> The same extension capture also records edits made by Continue and Cline/Roo
> Code when they run inside any VS Code-family editor (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf).
> JetBrains stays import-only (MCP is configured in-IDE, no stable global config);
> Devin stays import-only with live capture available by posting events to the
> authenticated daemon (`POST /events`). Added `windsurf`/`cascade`,
> `jetbrains`/`junie`, `devin`, `continue`, and `cline`/`roo` source
> normalization for `hooks ingest`. Cursor/Windsurf MCP writing is now a shared
> helper. Covered by a new `setup windsurf` CLI test plus extended `setup agents`
> assertions.
>
> **2026-06-01 — Global agent setup.** Added one-time user-level setup for
> Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cursor, and VS Code:
> `tellur setup agents` installs global hooks/settings with an absolute `tellur`
> executable path, generates a local Codex personal plugin/marketplace entry for
> manual workflows, writes Gemini CLI hooks, Antigravity hooks/MCP, Cursor
> MCP/settings, and VS Code settings, and routes hook/editor payloads through
> `tellur hooks ingest --auto-init` so new Git repositories can start capturing
> without per-project plugin invocation. Hook ingest now ignores invalid JSON,
> refuses malformed setup config instead of overwriting it, and never falls back
> to whole-tree capture when a tool hook lacks a file path.
>
> **2026-06-02 — Adoption import adapters.** Added five import adapters from the
> roadmap: Windsurf/Cascade, JetBrains AI Assistant / Junie, Devin, Continue, and
> Cline/Roo Code (the latter covers Roo Code via the shared task format). To keep
> these maintainable, the tolerant JSONL/array/envelope parsing loop, payload
> sanitization, prompt hashing, and field extraction now live in one shared
> module `crates/adapters/src/import.rs`; each new adapter only defines its
> tool-specific event-type mapping. `import.rs` also reads single JSON objects,
> envelope objects (`events`/`messages` arrays), and numeric epoch timestamps
> (Cline). `first_string`/`json_path` moved out of the Gemini adapter into the
> shared module. All five are wired into `tellur import <adapter> <source>`,
> registered as built-in adapters, and covered by unit + CLI integration tests.
> They are import-only because none expose a documented local lifecycle hook.
> Hardened after Codex review: envelope wrappers now propagate session/run
> identity onto child events; field extraction is a bounded recursive scan that
> reaches nested objects and Anthropic Messages `content`-block arrays (so Cline/
> Roo `tool_use` writes, Windsurf transcript `code_action`/`user_input`, and
> Continue `nextEditWithHistory`/`fileURI` are recognized); command events
> recover the command from a generic `text` field; and the prompt-hash key set is
> kept in sync with the redaction key set.
>
> **2026-06-02 — README discoverability refresh.** Updated the public README
> with a generated social/hero image, `https://tellur.dev`, clearer value
> proposition, badges, search-friendly AI code provenance language, and a
> stronger star/discovery prompt. No adapter behavior changed.
>
> **2026-06-01 — Adapter hardening.** Tightened adapter imports after review:
> imported events now preserve source IDs, timestamps, session IDs, actors, and
> event types while Tellur recomputes the local hash chain; malformed non-empty
> JSON/JSONL lines now fail instead of being silently dropped; Codex/Copilot
> prompt-like fields are hashed and retained metadata is sanitized; Claude Code
> hook capture is scoped to the hook file path when available; `tellur import
> aider <source>` now uses `<source>` as the Git repository path.
>
> **2026-05-31 — Git notes interop.** Added Git AI-compatible authorship notes
> support under `refs/notes/ai`: `tellur notes export/show/import/fetch/push`
> plus `install-config` for notes fetch/rewrite setup. Notes are a compact
> commit-attestation layer; Tellur's richer event log, redaction state, replay
> data, and policy evidence remain in local/private storage.
>
> **2026-05-31 — Codex + Copilot adapters.** Added `tellur import codex`
> for Codex CLI JSONL event streams/session transcripts and
> `tellur import copilot` for GitHub Copilot metadata exports. Both adapters
> normalize prompts, command events, file writes, and raw metadata into
> Tellur events and are covered by adapter unit tests plus CLI integration
> tests.
>
> **2026-05-31 — Dashboard live data.** The local daemon now backs the session
> replay dashboard with real indexed data: `GET /sessions` returns session rows
> with attribution stats, and `GET /sessions/{id}/events` returns timeline events
> for the selected session. The static dashboard client now understands canonical
> Tellur event wire types (`file.write`, `command.post_execute`, etc.) and
> escapes live event body text before rendering.
>
> **2026-05-31 — Code review & remediation.** A full review found that many
> modules previously marked ✅ were stubs or not wired together (watch, MCP,
> daemon, Claude Code hooks, gc, redact, Homebrew, npm) and that the core
> attribution pipeline was never connected end-to-end. All findings are
> documented in [`docs/FINDINGS.md`](docs/FINDINGS.md) and have been fixed:
> the capture → attribution → index → explain/blame/pr-report pipeline now
> works end-to-end, the daemon is loopback-only + token-authenticated, the MCP
> server speaks real stdio JSON-RPC, hooks use Claude Code's real schema, and
> two security issues (CI command injection, unauthenticated daemon) are
> resolved. That remediation pass was verified with `cargo build`,
> `cargo clippy` (0 warnings), and `cargo test`.

| 31 | `tellur redact` | 14 | ✅ Done | Rewrites stored payloads in place, records RedactionInfo, re-seals hash chain so `verify` stays intact |
| 31a | `tellur team report` | §6.11/§32 Step 20 | ✅ Done | Tier 0 team mode: aggregates `refs/notes/ai` notes over a `--base..--head` range into AI involvement by tool/model/author + provenance coverage. Markdown/`--json`. No server. `crates/core/src/report/team_report.rs` |

### Phase 4: Reports & Export (PRD secties 12, 15, 20)

## Wat is NIET uit de PRD opgepakt

Deze onderdelen staan in de PRD maar zijn bewust overgeslagen of vereisen Sydney's beslissing:

1. **Pricing / Business model** (PRD sectie 27-31) — niet relevant voor dev, Sydney beslist
2. **Enterprise team/server follow-ups** (PRD §6.11 / §16.2 Layer 5 / §32 Step 20)
   — Tier 0 and the self-host hub preview are implemented on both the SQLite and
   Postgres backends, with enterprise RBAC/SSO/SCIM. Remaining work: durable
   jobs and SCIM Group-based role sync.
3. **SOC 2 compliance** (PRD sectie 26) — far future
4. **Plugin SDK** (PRD sectie 25) — API stabiliteit eerst nodig
5. **Release signing** (PRD sectie 20) — na v1.0 (SLSA/SPDX *export* is wel klaar)
6. ~~**Session replay web dashboard met live data**~~ — ✅ Done via local daemon endpoints
7. ~~**GitHub Copilot / Codex CLI adapters**~~ — ✅ Done as import adapters

## Huidige Test Status

```
204 Rust tests, 0 failures, 0 clippy warnings. `cargo deny check` green.
- server:    59 tests (B0 config/health/errors + /metrics; B1 Argon2id tokens, org/member
             auth, hash-chained audit append/verify/tamper/tail-truncation/
             two-connection, authn + BOLA + auth-denied auditing; B2 repo
             get-or-create, per-repo event chain verify/tamper, tenant scoping,
             ingest authz/BOLA/role + empty/oversized caps + rate-limit 429 +
             recursive payload redaction)
- core:      72 tests (schema/event-type round-trip, glob matcher, storage,
             hash-chain verify + reseal, index session/attribution round-trip,

## Volgende Stappen (prioriteit)

1. ~~**Claude Code hook installer**~~ — ✅ Done
2. ~~**Aider commit parser**~~ — ✅ Done  
3. ~~**VS Code/Cursor-compatible extension**~~ — ✅ Done
4. ~~**Codex CLI adapter**~~ — ✅ Done
5. ~~**GitHub Copilot adapter**~~ — ✅ Done
6. ~~**Next first-party adapters for adoption**~~ — ✅ Done as import adapters (Windsurf/Cascade, JetBrains AI / Junie, Devin, Continue, Cline/Roo Code)
7. **Live capture beyond import** — ✅ Done for all adoption tools' durable
   surfaces. Windsurf/Cascade live via `tellur setup windsurf` (VS Code-compatible
   extension + MCP); Continue and Cline/Roo covered by the same extension inside
   any VS Code-family editor; JetBrains live via the `editor/tellur-jetbrains`
   IntelliJ plugin (`VFS_CHANGES` → `hooks ingest`); Devin live via the daemon
   `POST /webhook/devin` endpoint. Remaining (optional): lifecycle-hook capture
   for Windsurf/JetBrains if/when they document a local hook API; publish the
   JetBrains plugin to the Marketplace.
8. **Team/server mode** — proposal
   [`docs/proposals/TEAM_SERVER_MODE.md`](docs/proposals/TEAM_SERVER_MODE.md);
   reconciled with PRD §6.11 / §16.2 Layer 5 / §32 Step 20.
   **Tier 0 ✅ done** (`tellur team report` + example PR CI).
   **Tier 1 in progress** per
   [`docs/proposals/TEAM_SERVER_IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/proposals/TEAM_SERVER_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
   (B0–B6). **B0 ✅** scaffolding (config, errors, Store+SQLite, health, SECURITY/
   STRIDE/cargo-deny/CI). **B1 ✅** (branch `feat/server-b1-identity-tenancy`):
   roles + Argon2id API tokens, orgs/members, hash-chained audit log, deny-by-
   default auth extractor, tenant-scoped `/v1/me` + `/v1/orgs/{org}/me` (BOLA
   blocked), admin bootstrap CLI. **B2 ✅** (branch `feat/server-b2-ingest`):
   authenticated `POST .../repos/{repo}/events` with server-recomputed per-repo
   hash chain, inbound secret redaction, body/size + rate-limit guardrails.
   **B3 ✅** tenant-scoped read endpoints (`GET .../repos`, paginated
   `.../events`, `.../report`). **B4 ✅** (branch `feat/server-b4-policy-export`):
   central policy distribution (`PUT/GET .../policies[/{name}]`, validated +
   versioned) and an export portal (`GET .../export/events|audit`, admin,
   rate-limited). **B5 (partial) ✅** (branch `feat/server-b5-scale-ops`):
   `/metrics`, heavy-op offload, Docker/Compose packaging + CI build, and the
   `tellur policy pull` client. **Attribution ingest + SLSA/SPDX export ✅**
   (branch `feat/server-b6-attribution-slsa`): per-repo SLSA v1.0 + SPDX from
   ingested line-level attribution. **Postgres backend ✅** (branch
   `feat/server-postgres`): `PostgresStore` (r2d2 pool, NoTls) behind the same
   `Store` trait, selected via `TELLUR_DATABASE_URL`, with a `postgres:16` CI
   service running the integration tests. **B6 (enterprise) ✅ complete:**
   **fine-grained per-repo RBAC** (branch `feat/server-b6-repo-rbac`) — additive
   per-repo role grants (`max(org_role, grant)`); **OIDC SSO**
   (branch `feat/server-b6-oidc-sso`) — code+PKCE browser login, opaque session
   cookies, email-provisioned members; **SCIM 2.0** (branch `feat/server-b6-scim`)
   — `/scim/v2/Users` provisioning/deprovisioning via an org-scoped token, with
   `member.active` gating all auth paths. Still open: **queued/durable jobs**;
   SCIM Group-based role sync.
9. **Plugin SDK** — requires stable adapter/event API

## Concurrentieonderzoek (2026-05-31)

Directe concurrenten die hetzelfde probleem oplossen:

### 1. Git AI (usegitai.com)
- **Open-source** git extension
- Gebruikt **Git Notes** voor AI authorship tracking
- `git-ai blame` + `git-ai stats` commands
- Ondersteunt Agent Hooks voor automatische tracking
- `refs/notes/ai` open standard
- **+/−**: Git-native (goed), maar geen policy engine, geen redaction, geen export profiles

### 2. AgentBlame (mesa.dev/agentblame)
- **Line-level AI attribution** via git notes
- Combineert git blame met AI attributie
- Tool/model breakdown dashboards
- Ondersteunt Cursor, Claude Code, OpenCode
- **+/−**: Mooie UX, maar gesloten platform (SaaS?), geen policy/redaction

### 3. Entire CLI
- Captureert AI session transcripts in git commits
- Line-level AI vs human attributie
- **+/−**: Focus op session capture, minder breed dan Tellur

### 4. AI Footprint
- Git-native AI code tracking
- **+/−**: Vroeg stadium, vergelijkbare aanpak

### Tellur differentiators
1. **Policy engine** — YAML-based rules voor sensitive paths, required reviews, test evidence
2. **Secret redaction** — regex-based detection van API keys, tokens, passwords
3. **6 export profiles** — developer, OSS, corporate, audit, release, CI
4. **PR risk reports** — risico scoring, AI involvement stats, reviewer checklist
5. **Tamper-evident log** — SHA-256 hash chain (geen concurrent heeft dit)
6. **Multi-adapter** — Claude Code, Aider, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Generic uit de doos
7. **Rust** — single binary, snel, geen runtime dependency
8. **SLSA/SPDX ready** — export naar supply chain formats

### Actiepunten uit concurrentie
- Git Notes integratie uitbreiden met release/CI workflows waar nuttig
- Dashboard metrics (tool/model breakdown) toevoegen aan `tellur stats`
- `/ask` feature (chat met AI die code schreef) — uniek, overwegen voor later
